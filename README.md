# Telecom-Retention-Detection-using-Ensemble-Learning
A machine learning model built to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on usage and service data by  leveraging ensemble machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost. It includes EDA, data preprocessing,  model evaluation, and deployment through a flask web interface for real-time churn prediction and visualization.
